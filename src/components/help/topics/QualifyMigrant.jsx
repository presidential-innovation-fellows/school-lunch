          Your children may qualify as a migrant if you have moved your household into a different school district within the last three years to gain or look for temporary/seasonal work in agriculture or fishing.
        </p>
        <p>
        	If you believe children in your household meet one or more of these descriptions and you havenâ€™t been told your children will get free meals, please contact {organization.name}.
